# Fraud Detection ML

This repository contains a fraud detection machine learning project implemented using MLflow.

## Overview

The Fraud Detection ML project aims to develop a robust fraud detection system using machine learning techniques. MLflow, an open-source platform, is used to track, manage, and deploy machine learning models.

## Features

- Utilizes MLflow for experiment tracking, model versioning, and deployment.
- Implements various machine learning algorithms for fraud detection.
- Provides a web-based UI to track and visualize experiments and model performance.
- Enables model deployment and serving through MLflow's RESTful API.
